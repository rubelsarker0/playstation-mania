      "reviewerComment": "Amazing console!! The graphics to the load time to the smoothness of playing is all amazing but when I got the PlayStation, the power cord that came with it didn’t work so I had to use the power cord from my PS4 for it to work. But overall it’s still an amazing console and would definitely recommend buying it.",

They love this and boast amazing graphics and speed. Best thing was that they still can play their PS4 games on it though the graphics are same as the PS4 console for those.",
